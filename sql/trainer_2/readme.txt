Quickly converted to work on trinity by: deathwatch
Notes: I did not update this nor create this

Changelog:

11/11/2010

Converted existing sql to work with trinity

Fixed typo that caused warrior trainer to incorrectly display

Note: there are a few issues it appears present with the language of the weapons trainers display text..., as was present in the mangos version on 3.3.5 though the weapons trainers function properly.

Riding trainer and class trainers appear to function properly  though you will notice a few "non existing spell -ignore" statements in initial console load. (most likely due to the fact that I did not update this just merely converted existing mangos source into trinity so any issues the mangos source had may be present here).
